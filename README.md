# YTS_Clone_Back_End

This is the official repo for the YTS Clone back-end application.

## How to run

Make sure you have Node installed and set up in your system.

After cloning the repository:

1. Create a ".env" file in the project directory, create a `PORT` variable/key in the same file and set an appropriate port for the Express application (for example, 3000).

2. Open a shell instance in the project directory and run `npm i` (which produces the same effect as of `npm install`).

3. Finally, run the `npm start` command to execute the application.
